Identifiers make up a majority of the text in code. They are one of the most basic mediums through which developers describe the code they create and understand the code that others create. Therefore, understanding the patterns latent in identifier naming practices and how accurately we are able to automatically model these patterns is vital if researchers are to support developers and automated analysis approaches in comprehending and creating identifiers correctly and optimally. Our lab is dedicated to uncovering the meaning latent in identifier names. Recently, we have begun cataloguing identifier naming structures [here](https://github.com/SCANL/identifier_name_structure_catalogue). In addition, as research is completed we are constantly updating our [repository](https://github.com/SCANL/) with new datasets and tools to support researchers and developers in understanding, creating, and analyzing the natural language in their code. Please take a look.
