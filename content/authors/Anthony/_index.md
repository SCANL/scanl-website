Anthony Peruma is a Computing and Information Sciences Ph.D. student at [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://www.rit.edu/computing/phd-computing-and-information-sciences). Anthony studies identifier names in the source code by investigating how and why identifier names change (or evolve) in the source code. The overall goal of Anthony's research is to improve developer productivity by constructing a linguistic model to assist developers, in realtime, to identify poor quality identifier names and recommend appropriate replacements.
