A catalogue of common source code identifier naming structures derived from research.

<!--more-->
If you're interested learning more about identifier name structures and their meanings OR in material that can help you teach students at the grad/undergrad about identifier naming, our lab is putting together a living identifier name catalogue on Github: [https://github.com/SCANL/identifier_name_structure_catalogue](https://github.com/SCANL/identifier_name_structure_catalogue).

It is currently based on our paper: ["On the Generation, Structure, and Semantics of Grammar Patterns in Source Code Identifiers"](publication/2020-jss-generation). Over time, we would like to continue growing it as a resource on code naming practices for researchers, developers, and students alike!

We're happy to have any feedback (the README gives some instructions on how to do so) on improvements, corrections, or potential additions for the future!
