abstract: The impact of bad programming practices, such as code smells, in production
  code has been the focus of numerous studies in software engineering. Like production
  code, unit tests are also affected by bad programming practices which can have a
  negative impact on the quality and maintenance of a software system. While several
  studies addressed code and test smells in desktop applications, there is little
  knowledge of test smells in the context of mobile applications. In this study, we
  extend the existing catalog of test smells by identifying and defining new smells
  and survey over 40 developers who confirm that our proposed smells are bad programming
  practices in test suites. Additionally, we perform an empirical study on the occurrences
  and distribution of the proposed smells on 656 open-source Android applications
  (apps). Our findings show a widespread occurrence of test smells in apps. We also
  show that apps tend to exhibit test smells early in their lifetime with different
  degrees of co-occurrences on different smell types. This empirical study demonstrates
  that test smells can be used as an indicator for necessary preventive software maintenance
  for test suites.
