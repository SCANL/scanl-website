abstract: Unknowingly, identifiers in the source code of a software system play a
  vital role in determining the quality of the system. Ambiguous and confusing identifier
  names lead developers to not only misunderstand the behavior of the code but also
  increases comprehension time and thereby causes a loss in productivity. Even though
  correcting poor names through rename operations is a viable option for solving this
  problem, renaming itself is an act of rework and is not immune to defect injection.
  In this study, we aim to understand the motivations that drive developers to name
  and rename identifiers and the decisions they make in determining the name. Using
  our results, we propose the development of a linguistic model that determines identifier
  names based on the behavior of the identifier. As a prerequisite to constructing
  the model, we conduct multiple studies to determine the features that should feed
  into the model. In this paper, we discuss findings from our completed studies and
  justify the continuation of research on this topic through further studies.
