abstract: 'Identifier names are the atoms of program comprehension. Weak identifier
  names decrease developer productivity and degrade the performance of automated approaches
  that leverage identifier names in source code analysis; threatening many of the
  advantages which stand to be gained from advances in artificial intelligence and
  machine learning. Therefore, it is vital to support developers in naming and renaming
  identifiers. In this paper, we extend our prior work, which studies the primary
  method through which names evolve: rename refactorings. In our prior work, we contextualize
  rename changes by examining commit messages and other refactorings. In this extension,
  we further consider data type changes which co-occur with these renames, with a
  goal of understanding how data type changes influence the structure and semantics
  of renames. In the long term, the outcomes of this study will be used to support
  research into: (1) recommending when a rename should be applied, (2) recommending
  how to rename an identifier, and (3) developing a model that describes how developers
  mentally synergize names using domain and project knowledge. We provide insights
  into how our data can support rename recommendation and analysis in the future,
  and reflect on the significant challenges, highlighted by our study, for future
  research in recommending renames.'
