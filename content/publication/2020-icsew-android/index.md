abstract: An essential activity of software maintenance is the refactoring of source
  code. Refactoring operations enable developers to take necessary actions to correct
  bad programming practices (i.e., smells) in the source code of both production and
  test files. With unit testing being a vital and fundamental part of ensuring the
  quality of a system, developers must address smelly test code. In this paper, we
  empirically explore the impact and relationship between refactoring operations and
  test smells in 250 open-source Android applications (apps). Our experiments showed
  that the type of refactoring operations performed by developers on test files differ
  from those performed on non-test files. Further, results around test smells show
  a co-occurrence between certain smell types and refactorings, and how refactorings
  are utilized to eliminate smells. Findings from this study will not only further
  our knowledge of refactoring operations on test files, but will also help developers
  in understanding the possible ways on how to maintain their apps.
