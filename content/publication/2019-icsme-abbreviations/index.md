abstract: Expanding abbreviations is an important text normalization technique used
  for the purpose of either increasing developer comprehension or supporting the application
  of natural-language-based tools for source code identifiers. This paper closely
  studies abbreviations and where their expansions occur in different software artifacts.
  Without abbreviation expansion, developers will spend more time in comprehending
  the code they need to update, and tools analyzing software may obtain weak or non-generalizable
  results. There are numerous techniques for expanding abbreviations, most of which
  struggle to reach an average expansion accuracy of 59-62% on general source code
  identifiers. In this paper, we reveal some characteristics of abbreviations and
  their expansions through an empirical study of 861 abbreviation-expansion pairs
  extracted from 5 open-source systems in addition to analyzing previous literature.
  We use these characteristics to identify how current approaches may be complementary
  and how their results should be reported in the future to help maximize both our
  understanding of how they compare with other expansion techniques and their reproducibility.
