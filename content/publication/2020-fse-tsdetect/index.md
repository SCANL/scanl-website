abstract: "The test code, just like production source code, is subject to bad design\
  \ and programming practices, also known as smells. The presence of test smells in\
  \ a software project may affect the quality, maintainability, and extendability\
  \ of test suites making them less effective in finding potential faults and quality\
  \ issues in the project's production code. In this paper, we introduce tsDetect,\
  \ an automated test smell detection tool for Java software systems that uses a set\
  \ of detection rules to locate existing test smells in test code. We evaluate the\
  \ effectiveness of tsDetect on a benchmark of 65 unit test files containing instances\
  \ of 19 test smell types. Results show that tsDetect achieves a high detection accuracy\
  \ with an average precision score of 96% and an average recall score of 97%. tsDetect\
  \ is publicly available, with a demo video, at: https://testsmells.github.io/"
