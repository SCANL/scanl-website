abstract: It is good practice to name test methods such that they are comprehensible
  to developers; they must be written in such a way that their purpose and functionality
  are clear to those who will maintain them. Unfortunately, there is little automated
  support for writing or maintaining the names of test methods. This can lead to inconsistent
  and low-quality test names and increase the maintenance cost of supporting these
  methods. Due to this risk, it is essential to help developers in maintaining their
  test method names over time. In this paper, we use grammar patterns, and how they
  relate to test method behavior, to understand test naming practices. This data will
  be used to support an automated tool for maintaining test names.
