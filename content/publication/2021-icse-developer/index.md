abstract: This paper describes the results of a large (+1100 responses) survey of
  professional software developers concerning standards for naming source code methods.
  The various standards for source code method names are derived from and supported
  in the software engineering literature. The goal of the survey is to determine if
  there is a general consensus among developers that the standards are accepted and
  used in practice. Additionally, the paper examines factors such as years of experience
  and programming language knowledge in the context of survey responses. The survey
  results show that participants very much agree about the importance of various standards
  and how they apply to names. Additionally, the survey shows that years of experience
  and the programming language the participants use has almost no effect on their
  responses.
