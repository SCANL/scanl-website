abstract: Identifier names are the atoms of comprehension; weak identifier names decrease
  productivity by increasing the chance that developers make mistakes and increasing
  the time taken to understand chunks of code. Therefore, it is vital to support developers
  in naming, and renaming, identifiers. In this paper, we study how terms in an identifier
  change during the application of rename refactorings and contextualize these changes
  using co-occurring refactorings and commit messages. The goal of this work is to
  understand how different development activities affect the type of changes applied
  to names during a rename. Results of this study can help researchers understand
  more about developers' naming habits and support developers in determining when
  to rename and what words to use.
